# About

Millions of years ago, in the Age of the Kashyapa Buddha, I used to live on a mountain named Hyakujo, where I was the abbot of a Zen monastery. One day, the smartest of my students asked me – tell me, O’ Great Master, is a person of great practice also subject to the law of cause-and-effect? Confident of my learning I replied – no, such a person does not fall into the law of cause-and-effect. For that unforgivable sin, I was reborn as a wild fox for five-hundred lifetimes, until Master Hyakujo became the abbot of the monastery on the Hyakujo mountain, and liberated me by declaring the truth of the law of cause-and-effect.

The law of cause-and-effect is clear as noonday but it takes five-hundred lifetimes to realize.
